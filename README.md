🧩 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the amount of CO₂ emissions (g/km) produced by vehicles based on their key characteristics such as engine size, number of cylinders, fuel type, transmission type, and fuel consumption. By analyzing these factors, the model aims to help understand how different vehicle features contribute to carbon emissions and support the development of eco-friendly vehicle designs and emission reduction strategies.
